# Movie App 
Movie app powered by the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). I made this for fun primarily to learn more about react hooks. 

# Live Site Here

Deployed using netlify ✨ feel free to:
- Search for some of your favorite movies
- Load more movies (note that more movies loaded persists even when you reload the page!)
- Click on a movie to see all the actors in it and some more metadata about the movie
- Enjoy!
